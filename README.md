Hi!
This will be my first project in The Odin Project.

How Exciting!

I've been tasked to reflect on what I've learned.
However, I've already a few years experience of IT behind me, but nonetheless. I still learned a ton.

I've learned some stuff I can do in my terminal window. Every folder or file I've created, moved, copied or deleted. Has been via the terminal.
Yes even the cute dog pictures. I've learned to move them from my Downloads folder into a project folder too.
It wasn't that hard, but you had to type a lot haha.

I also learned some HTML basics that flew past my head in the lessons I've been taught in school. Feels nice to refresh some memories!
